## Understanding Your Crew
The galactIQ Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.

Therer are six agents in the galactIQ Crew:
- **spacez_manager**: Receives query and assigns the tasks to appropriate agents. Return response to customer and for unresolved queries send it to the backend team.
- **spacez_mission_agent**: Provide information about space missions and their payloads
- **spacez_satellite_data_agent**: Provide information about satellite data
- **spacez_celestial_events_agent**: Provide information about celestial events
- **spacez_research_papers_agent**: Provide information about research papers
